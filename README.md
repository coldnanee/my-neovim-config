Neovim is simpler and more convenient than it seems ! <br/>
You can install Neovim <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim">here</a> - just choose a convenient way for you, or y can use snap (linux):
<br/>

```
	$ sudo apt install snapd
 	$ sudo snap install --classic nvim
    
    * restart terminal after this. 
```
<br/>
<br/>

If you want to configure neovim the same way as I (linux) - do then follow these steps:

```
	$ mkdir ~/.config/nvim
	$ git clone https://github.com/coldnanee/my-neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
    
    *restart terminal after this.
```
<br/>
You will also need to install nerd font to display the icons correctly. In my case, I use JetBrainsMono. You can find and download it <a href="https://www.nerdfonts.com">here</a> 
<br/>
<br/>
I think you were able to figure out the installation and configuration and started using a wonderful code editor! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
